Project page for simulated butterfly landscapes.

Most recent update: 04/09/2025

Motivation: Butterfly declines have been widely reported across the world. Species in decline are not limited to those traditionally of concern, such as small species with limited range sizes. In fact, in the western United States, some butterflies in the greatest decline have continental distributions. Species with larger distributions are more likely to encounter multiple anthropogenic stressors, and this may cause greater rates of decline for wide-ranging species rather than small-ranged species.

Goal:
  1) To investiage how landscapes of varying configurations interact with species dispersal distances to drive population sizes.
  2) To investigate how restoration in a landscape context interacts with species dispersal capabilities.
